You are a small green ball sitting in a grid full of obstacles. Your aim is to collect all the gems without running into any mines.<br><br>

    <p class="cont_4">
    You can move the ball in any orthogonal <em>or diagonal</em> direction. Once the ball starts moving, it will continue until something stops it. A wall directly in its path will stop it (but if it is moving diagonally, it will move through a diagonal gap between two other walls without stopping). Also, some of the squares are &#8216;stops&#8217;; when the ball moves on to a stop, it will stop moving no matter what direction it was going in. Gems do <em>not</em> stop the ball; it picks them up and keeps on going.<br><br>Running into a mine is fatal. Even if you picked up the last gem in the same move which then hit a mine, the game will count you as dead rather than victorious.
