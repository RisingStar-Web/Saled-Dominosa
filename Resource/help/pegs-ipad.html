    A number of pegs are placed in holes on a board. You can remove a peg by jumping an adjacent peg over it (horizontally or vertically) to a vacant hole on the other side. <br><br>

    This game, best known as <a name="i1"></a>&#8216;Peg Solitaire&#8217;, is possibly one of the oldest puzzle games still commonly known.<br><br>

    Your aim is to remove all but one of the pegs initially present. Whether you are given a board of a standard shape or a randomly generated shape, it at least have one solution.<br><br>

    To move a peg, press it from its current position to its final position. If the final position is exactly two holes away from the initial position, is currently unoccupied by a peg, and there is a peg in the intervening square, the move will be permitted and the intervening peg will be removed.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="cont_4">
    Vacant spaces which you can move a peg into are marked with holes. A space with no peg and no hole is not available for moving at all: it is an obstacle which you must work around.
